=head1 NAME

Devel::Mutator - Mutation testing for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    mutator mutate lib/MyModule.pm
    mutator test

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Devel::Mutator is a mutation testing toolkit for Perl. Mutation testing is
changing the working program in different ways and checking that the test suite
fails and thus detecting the bad testing.

=head2 How it works

First we generate mutated code. For example every occurance of C<=> is replaced
by C<!=>. All the mutants are collected in the C<mutants/> directory. Then we
run the tests replacing original code by the mutant. If the test suite does not
fail when the code is changed it is reported with a C<diff> output, which helps
to see the problem.

         my $self = shift;

         $self->{constraints} ||= [];
    -    $self->{messages}    //= {};
    +    $self->{messages}    ||= {};

         $self->{trim} = 1 unless defined $self->{trim};

Here we can see that the test suite does not check the need for C<//>.

=head2 Warning

The original code is replaced by the mutants, so make sure it is under a VCS if
something bad happens.  This is the easiest and the 100% working way. Maybe
this will be changed in the future when a better way is found.

=head2 Mutation testing drawbacks

There are several drawbacks.

=head3 The equivalent program

The equivalent program can be produced thus failing the test. There is no
solution to that for now.

=head3 Infinite loops

Infinite loops can be created easily. The solution is to run the test suite
limited in time through a C<timeout> option, which is 10s by default. After 10s
of running, the test suite is killed and C<n/a timeout> is reported.
